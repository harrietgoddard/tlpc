    <h1 class="heading-font">Why old cookware is better than new (sometimes).</h1>
    <p class="about-text">
      When it comes to cookware, newer isn't always better. At The Loved Pot Co., we spend our days restoring old pots and pans for a reason: the best cookware isn't always fresh off the production line. Here's why second-hand pieces often deserve a second look.
    </p>
    <h5>Built to last.</h5>
    <p class="about-text">
      Many vintage pieces were crafted to a higher standard. Thick-gauge metals, solid rivets, and balanced forms were the norm. Before mass production took over, pots were made with durability and performance in mind. A well-made cast iron or copper pan from decades ago might still outperform its modern-day counterpart.
    </p>
    <h5>They just cook better.</h5>
    <p class="about-text">
      There's a reason chefs still swear by certain old pans. Properly seasoned cast iron develops a naturally non-stick surface and unbeatable heat retention. Older copper pans are often thicker and distribute heat more evenly. Even enamelled cookware, when cared for, keeps its charm and performance for generations.
    </p>
    <h5>They age gracefully.</h5>
    <p class="about-text">
      While cheap materials break down, quality ones age beautifully. A patina on copper, darkened seasoning on cast iron, or even a few worn edges on a wooden spoon - these are signs of use, not failure. They tell a story and often enhance the item's function rather than take away from it.
    </p>
    <h5>It's better for the planet.</h5>
    <p class="about-text">
      Choosing vintage or second-hand cookware reduces demand for new manufacturing and diverts waste from landfill. There are no plastic handles or synthetic coatings to worry about - just timeless materials like cast iron, copper, stainless steel and wood. With the right care, these items can last another lifetime.
    </p>
    <h5>There's character you just can't fake.</h5>
    <p class="about-text">
      No two second-hand pieces are the same. There might be a scratch where someone stirred their Sunday sauce, or a faint mark left by a wooden spoon. This wear doesn't take away from the value - it adds to the charm. Every piece has a story, and becomes part of yours when you cook with it.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      At The Loved Pot Co., we carefully restore these pieces so they're ready for modern kitchens. We clean, test, and inspect every item, so you get the joy of vintage cookware with the peace of mind that it still performs beautifully.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
      Whether you're a collector, a home cook, or simply someone who appreciates good design, old cookware might just be the upgrade you didn't know you needed.
